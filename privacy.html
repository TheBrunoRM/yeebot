        <h2>Data collection</h2>
        <p>YeeBot collects data that is provided from users by commands like <span>bio</span> or <span>language</span>,
            and
            by server owners by commands like <span>settings</span> or <span>roleprefix</span>.</p>
        <p>This data is only used for the bot to work properly for each server and user.</p>
        <p>If <span>server snipes</span> are enabled in a server's settings, it will also collect information about
            edited and deleted messages, and store it for 30 days after the messages have been edited or deleted.</p>
        <p>That's it, we don't collect any other data.</p>
        <p>You can request the deletion of your or your server's data on dms.</p>
